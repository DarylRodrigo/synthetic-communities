I still believe in Medicare-for-All, but maybe I was too quick to dismiss the complexities of fostering innovation. His argument about competition made sense, and I should probably explore that angle more.\n\nI think I did okay, but I could have been more specific about how Medicare-for-All would actually *boost* innovation, beyond just saying it would. That felt a bit\u2026 vague. The debate definitely solidified my core belief that everyone deserves healthcare, but I need to be more prepared to address the legitimate concerns about the practical implications of my proposals.

Honestly, that gave me pause. I still believe in the free market, but her argument about the potential for focusing on patient needs instead of profits is something I need to consider more deeply. I felt authentic when talking about competition, but I struggled to give specific examples of how it boosts innovation; I just repeated the same talking points.
