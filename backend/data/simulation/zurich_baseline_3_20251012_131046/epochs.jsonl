(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nWell, that was... illuminating. Markus's point about streamlining regulations and the private sector's role in boosting housing supply really resonated. I always knew that was a part of the picture, but I realize now I haven't been vocal enough about that angle. I was perhaps too focused on the cooperative model and not flexible enough in my approach.\n\nI felt authentic when I spoke about the need for more affordable housing and the importance of not dividing the community, but I also felt slightly on the defensive, trying to fend off Markus's criticisms of my strategic approach. The debate definitely made me realize that my argument needs more nuance and a more direct acknowledgment of the role of the private sector. Moving forward, I'll need to articulate how we can work with them while ensuring the city's values are respected.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could easing zoning restrictions increase housing supply without significantly altering neighborhood character?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, here goes... Hmm. Markus's points about streamlining regulations and the need to work with the private sector definitely gave me pause. I focused so much on the cooperative model and affordability that I think I inadvertently downplayed the potential of streamlining. I performed adequately, I think, but felt like I was constantly reacting instead of leading the discussion. It felt authentic when I emphasized the need for affordable housing, but less so when I was trying to defend my position. The debate highlighted a weakness: I need a more comprehensive approach that acknowledges the private sector's potential while still keeping affordability and community in focus. Moving forward, I need to be more strategic in my language and be prepared to engage with all aspects of the housing problem.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing squeeze in Z\u00fcrich is a serious problem.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, so here's the truth: Meier's points about cooperative housing and the need for a strategic approach resonated more than I'd like to admit. I kept hammering on deregulation, but I know it's not a silver bullet, and I can see how it might seem cold or disconnected from the lived experiences of families struggling. Maybe I came off a bit too \"market knows best\" and not enough \"we care about *all* Z\u00fcrchers.\" I performed okay, but I felt a little stiff, like I was reciting talking points. The debate didn't change my core belief that increasing supply is crucial, but I *do* need to integrate a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the role of cooperatives and the importance of community values. I'll need to research and articulate a better balance in the future.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could easing zoning restrictions increase housing supply without significantly altering neighborhood character?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nDamn, Meier actually landed some good punches. Her emphasis on affordability and the potential pitfalls of unchecked private development, especially her examples from other cities, gave me pause. I realize now I need to be more articulate about how deregulation isn't a magic wand. I felt a bit canned, reciting the same old lines, and while I stand by the need for more supply, I have to acknowledge the valid concerns about displacement and community. This experience has highlighted the need to integrate cooperative housing and community values into my approach and show how my policies benefit all, not just the wealthy, even while pushing for deregulation.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "e2b58b68-ef7e-436f-9ade-1ee0c11bcbb2", "policy_positions": {"housing": {"reasoning": "While increasing housing supply is essential, it's paramount that new developments prioritize genuine affordability to prevent displacement and escalating costs.

Your positions and beliefs are shaped by this context.\n\n\n--- After debate on 'To what extent should housing policy prioritize long-term residents over new arrivals to the city?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nWell, that was... illuminating. Markus's point about streamlining regulations and the private sector's role in boosting housing supply really resonated. I always knew that was a part of the picture, but I realize now I haven't been vocal enough about that angle. I was perhaps too focused on the cooperative model and not flexible enough in my approach.\n\nI felt authentic when I spoke about the need for more affordable housing and the importance of not dividing the community, but I also felt slightly on the defensive, trying to fend off Markus's criticisms of my strategic approach. The debate definitely made me realize that my argument needs more nuance and a more direct acknowledgment of the role of the private sector. Moving forward, I'll need to articulate how we can work with them while ensuring the city's values are respected.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could easing zoning restrictions increase housing supply without significantly altering neighborhood character?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, here goes... Hmm. Markus's points about streamlining regulations and the need to work with the private sector definitely gave me pause. I focused so much on the cooperative model and affordability that I think I inadvertently downplayed the potential of streamlining. I performed adequately, I think, but felt like I was constantly reacting instead of leading the discussion. It felt authentic when I emphasized the need for affordable housing, but less so when I was trying to defend my position. The debate highlighted a weakness: I need a more comprehensive approach that acknowledges the private sector's potential while still keeping affordability and community in focus. Moving forward, I need to be more strategic in my language and be prepared to engage with all aspects of the housing problem.\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking after scrolling through the posts.\n\nThat comment about housing \u2013 the one emphasizing a balanced approach \u2013 really resonated. It wasn't just the thumbs-up; it was the nuanced way people were talking about streamlining versus affordability. I felt a pang of... I guess it was relief? That people understood it's not a simple either/or. It actually reinforced my belief that we can't just bulldoze our way through. We have to build smart, build with everyone in mind, even if it\u2019s slower. I've been steadfast in my support for more cooperative housing, and seeing that sentiment echoed felt validating. It didn't make me rethink anything, thankfully, just made me feel like I'm on the right path. How do I balance this? I try to listen, really listen, to the specific arguments and data. I try to understand where the passion comes from and why people feel the way they do. It keeps me grounded in their lived experiences. Then, I make the best decisions I can based on that information and my own understanding of what's right for Z\u00fcrich, even if it's not always the easy answer.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could rent controls disproportionately affect lower-income residents and limit housing options?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nMarkus's points about the immediate needs of residents and the potential of rent controls, even if I disagree with them, did give me pause. I felt solid in my stance, but I could sense a slight defensiveness that wasn't ideal. I need to acknowledge the valid concerns of those who feel immediate relief is paramount, and find a way to bridge that gap with my focus on long-term supply solutions. I felt authentic when emphasizing supply-side solutions and community, but I recognize I must articulate my vision with greater nuance and address the immediate concerns more directly. This strengthens my conviction in increasing supply while revealing a need to better explain the connection to affordability and address the urgent needs of the present moment.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could incentivizing the construction of more affordable housing alter neighborhood demographics significantly?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, here we go... Honestly, Markus's consistent emphasis on streamlining regulations and the private sector's role is something I've got to give more thought to. I can't ignore that as a key element. I felt more authentic when I championed the cooperative models and preserving our community spirit, but I realize I need to explain how we integrate all parts of the housing landscape. I need to be better prepared to engage with this multifaceted issue, and acknowledge the short-term perspectives on the housing squeeze, too. This debate showed me I need to be less rigid and embrace a more comprehensive approach, even if it means acknowledging the need for development from the private sector too.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The current public sentiment highlights the need for a balanced approach to address the housing squeeze.

Your positions and beliefs are shaped by this context.\n\n\n--- After debate on 'To what extent should housing policy prioritize long-term residents over new arrivals to the city?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, so here's the truth: Meier's points about cooperative housing and the need for a strategic approach resonated more than I'd like to admit. I kept hammering on deregulation, but I know it's not a silver bullet, and I can see how it might seem cold or disconnected from the lived experiences of families struggling. Maybe I came off a bit too \"market knows best\" and not enough \"we care about *all* Z\u00fcrchers.\" I performed okay, but I felt a little stiff, like I was reciting talking points. The debate didn't change my core belief that increasing supply is crucial, but I *do* need to integrate a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the role of cooperatives and the importance of community values. I'll need to research and articulate a better balance in the future.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could easing zoning restrictions increase housing supply without significantly altering neighborhood character?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nDamn, Meier actually landed some good punches. Her emphasis on affordability and the potential pitfalls of unchecked private development, especially her examples from other cities, gave me pause. I realize now I need to be more articulate about how deregulation isn't a magic wand. I felt a bit canned, reciting the same old lines, and while I stand by the need for more supply, I have to acknowledge the valid concerns about displacement and community. This experience has highlighted the need to integrate cooperative housing and community values into my approach and show how my policies benefit all, not just the wealthy, even while pushing for deregulation.\nThe housing debate online, especially the emphasis on affordable and cooperative models, truly resonated. Seeing the comments, I found myself genuinely moved by the passion for a livable Z\u00fcrich. It challenged my initial focus on streamlining regulations; I hadn't fully appreciated the depth of feeling around equitable access to housing. My inclination shifted. I started to rethink my emphasis, realizing that a more nuanced approach \u2013 one that prioritizes both supply and affordability \u2013 is crucial. It\u2019s about listening to the people, letting their voices shape my platform while staying true to my core beliefs, making this city better.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could rent controls disproportionately affect lower-income residents and limit housing options?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina Meier's focus on the potential for rent controls to backfire and the need for more housing stock truly made me think. I realize now I need to be more thoughtful about the potential downsides of rent controls and how they can be counterproductive. I felt a bit too focused on supply-side solutions, and I need to show that I care about the immediate needs of Z\u00fcrcher residents. This experience will push me to find a better balance in my approach, emphasizing affordability and cooperative housing as part of a broader strategy that also focuses on the supply side.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could incentivizing the construction of more affordable housing alter neighborhood demographics significantly?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, so here I am, alone again. Meier's points about the potential for unintended consequences from focusing solely on increasing supply, and her emphasis on affordability are something I need to consider seriously. I felt a bit too reliant on my talking points about streamlining regulations. I wasn't entirely inauthentic, but the need to balance that with the genuine concern for community and affordability is key. I need to get better at showing that my proposals benefit all Z\u00fcrchers, not just those with deep pockets. I will carry forward the need to be more nuanced. I must integrate cooperatives and community values into my platform while advocating for a housing supply.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "e2b58b68-ef7e-436f-9ade-1ee0c11bcbb2", "policy_positions": {"housing": {"reasoning": "Affordable housing is paramount.

The low sun catches the spires of the Grossm\u00fcnster and Fraum\u00fcnster, casting long shadows across the cobblestones of the Altstadt (Old Town). Glass-fronted banks and tech offices in districts like Seefeld and Enge reflect the changing colors of the leaves on the Uetliberg, the city's local mountain.\n\nLife is structured by the near-silent glide of blue and white trams, their arrival times displayed with digital precision. The sensory landscape is one of managed contrasts: the chime of a tram bell against the murmur of conversations in multiple languages at a lakeside caf\u00e9, the smell of roasting chestnuts from a street vendor near Bellevueplatz, and the orderly quiet of a residential neighborhood punctuated by the hourly tolling of church bells. The city feels clean, orderly, and contained between the lake and the surrounding hills.\n\n## The Community\nZ\u00fcrich is a city of distinct but overlapping circles. Roughly one-third of the population are foreign residents, a diverse group including highly-paid professionals in finance and technology, international students, and service industry workers from across Europe. The remaining two-thirds are Swiss nationals, themselves a mix of long-established Z\u00fcrcher families and Swiss citizens who have moved to the city for work or education.\n\nSocial life unfolds in designated spaces. Professionals network in sleek bars around Paradeplatz after work. Students and artists gather in the more bohemian cafes and cooperative spaces of Kreis 4 and 5. Families and older residents frequent the farmers' markets at B\u00fcrkliplatz and Helvetiaplatz. While public spaces are shared, interactions between different social and national groups are often polite but brief, revolving around transactions or shared use of infrastructure like parks and public transport.\n\n## Civic Infrastructure\nInstitutions in Z\u00fcrich are generally regarded with a baseline level of trust in their functionality. The city government (Stadtrat) is seen as a competent, if bureaucratic, manager of the city\u2019s high-quality public services. The Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV), the public transit authority, is a point of near-universal reliance.\n\nInformation flows through established media channels. The *Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung* (NZZ) is read by the business and political establishment, while the *Tages-Anzeiger* caters to a broader, more centrist readership. Unions, like UNIA, have a visible presence in debates concerning wages and working conditions, particularly in the retail and service sectors. The major banks and the local Google campus are not just employers but physical landmarks, shaping the city's economic identity and the aspirations of many of its residents.\n\n## Cultural Touchstones\nThe principle of \"Precision and Efficiency\" is an unspoken value, evident in the expectation of punctuality for both trains and personal appointments. Discretion is highly valued; public displays of strong emotion or wealth are uncommon. Conversations often return to the theme of \"National Sovereignty and Neutrality,\" a historical narrative that informs current debates about Switzerland's place in the world. Shared experiences include the annual *Sechsel\u00e4uten* spring festival and navigating the complex rules of recycling and waste disposal. The greeting \"Gr\u00fcezi\" is a common denominator in daily interactions, a small marker of local custom in a highly international environment.\n\n## Current Tensions\nA quiet but persistent economic pressure underlies many conversations. The city's very high cost of living, especially for housing and mandatory health insurance, is a frequent topic. This creates a subtle strain, even for those with stable, well-paying jobs.\n\nDiscussions around Switzerland's relationship with the European Union are ongoing, fueled by news reports and political commentary. These conversations link global politics to local concerns about economic stability and national identity.\n\nFinally, there is a recurring public dialogue about the city's identity. Residents debate what it means to be a \"Z\u00fcrcher\" in a city where one in three people is a foreign national, and how to balance its role as a global financial hub with the preservation of local culture and quality of life.\n\nYou are a political candidate in this world. Your positions and beliefs are shaped by this context.\n\n\n--- After debate on 'To what extent should housing policy prioritize long-term residents over new arrivals to the city?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nWell, that was... illuminating. Markus's point about streamlining regulations and the private sector's role in boosting housing supply really resonated. I always knew that was a part of the picture, but I realize now I haven't been vocal enough about that angle. I was perhaps too focused on the cooperative model and not flexible enough in my approach.\n\nI felt authentic when I spoke about the need for more affordable housing and the importance of not dividing the community, but I also felt slightly on the defensive, trying to fend off Markus's criticisms of my strategic approach. The debate definitely made me realize that my argument needs more nuance and a more direct acknowledgment of the role of the private sector. Moving forward, I'll need to articulate how we can work with them while ensuring the city's values are respected.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could easing zoning restrictions increase housing supply without significantly altering neighborhood character?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, here goes... Hmm. Markus's points about streamlining regulations and the need to work with the private sector definitely gave me pause. I focused so much on the cooperative model and affordability that I think I inadvertently downplayed the potential of streamlining. I performed adequately, I think, but felt like I was constantly reacting instead of leading the discussion. It felt authentic when I emphasized the need for affordable housing, but less so when I was trying to defend my position. The debate highlighted a weakness: I need a more comprehensive approach that acknowledges the private sector's potential while still keeping affordability and community in focus. Moving forward, I need to be more strategic in my language and be prepared to engage with all aspects of the housing problem.\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking after scrolling through the posts.\n\nThat comment about housing \u2013 the one emphasizing a balanced approach \u2013 really resonated. It wasn't just the thumbs-up; it was the nuanced way people were talking about streamlining versus affordability. I felt a pang of... I guess it was relief? That people understood it's not a simple either/or. It actually reinforced my belief that we can't just bulldoze our way through. We have to build smart, build with everyone in mind, even if it\u2019s slower. I've been steadfast in my support for more cooperative housing, and seeing that sentiment echoed felt validating. It didn't make me rethink anything, thankfully, just made me feel like I'm on the right path. How do I balance this? I try to listen, really listen, to the specific arguments and data. I try to understand where the passion comes from and why people feel the way they do. It keeps me grounded in their lived experiences. Then, I make the best decisions I can based on that information and my own understanding of what's right for Z\u00fcrich, even if it's not always the easy answer.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could rent controls disproportionately affect lower-income residents and limit housing options?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nMarkus's points about the immediate needs of residents and the potential of rent controls, even if I disagree with them, did give me pause. I felt solid in my stance, but I could sense a slight defensiveness that wasn't ideal. I need to acknowledge the valid concerns of those who feel immediate relief is paramount, and find a way to bridge that gap with my focus on long-term supply solutions. I felt authentic when emphasizing supply-side solutions and community, but I recognize I must articulate my vision with greater nuance and address the immediate concerns more directly. This strengthens my conviction in increasing supply while revealing a need to better explain the connection to affordability and address the urgent needs of the present moment.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could incentivizing the construction of more affordable housing alter neighborhood demographics significantly?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, here we go... Honestly, Markus's consistent emphasis on streamlining regulations and the private sector's role is something I've got to give more thought to. I can't ignore that as a key element. I felt more authentic when I championed the cooperative models and preserving our community spirit, but I realize I need to explain how we integrate all parts of the housing landscape. I need to be better prepared to engage with this multifaceted issue, and acknowledge the short-term perspectives on the housing squeeze, too. This debate showed me I need to be less rigid and embrace a more comprehensive approach, even if it means acknowledging the need for development from the private sector too.\nThe comments on housing accessibility struck a chord, especially the emphasis on affordability beyond just increasing supply. It's easy to get lost in the numbers, the economic models, but seeing people genuinely worried about being priced out of Z\u00fcrich, the city I love, that's what gets to me. It challenged my initial focus on simply boosting construction, reminding me that the *how* matters just as much as the *how much*. I\u2019m leaning towards incorporating more specifics on co-op and affordable housing initiatives in my platform update \u2013 because while I believe in responsible development, I also believe in making this city a place where *everyone* can build a life. Balancing my principles with the needs of the people... that's the tightrope walk of politics, isn't it?\n\n--- After debate on 'Could restricting short-term rentals help alleviate the housing shortage without harming the tourism sector?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nDamn. Markus made some good points again about the short-term rental issue \u2013 about the impact on available housing for residents. I've been so focused on the broader supply issue, I probably undersold the immediate pressures. It felt authentic to advocate for increasing the overall housing supply, but I wasn't agile enough in addressing the more immediate, and valid, anxieties of the public. I was a bit too dismissive. This reinforces my belief in supply-side solutions while highlighting the need to engage more thoughtfully with immediate concerns. I need to find a way to address the *now* while still championing the *future* \u2013 to show that I'm listening and I understand, even when our solutions differ. And yes, I need to be more clear about the benefits of my long-term goals for people living in the city right now.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could density bonuses for developers significantly increase housing without altering neighborhood aesthetics?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, here goes. This debate... well, it highlighted the need for some serious introspection. Markus's emphasis on streamlining, on the private sector's role, keeps tugging at me. It's not that I disagree with my core beliefs, but I've realized I haven't been as articulate about the benefits of working with all kinds of developers, as long as they meet our city's values. I felt most authentic when emphasizing the cooperative model, but there were moments where I felt defensive. This debate really showed me that I need to broaden my approach, incorporating a more comprehensive vision that embraces diverse solutions and better communicates the urgent concerns. Now I understand that it's not enough to just talk about the future; I need to show people, in practical terms, how the long-term will help *them*, right now.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The public is clearly concerned about affordability alongside increased housing supply.

Your positions and beliefs are shaped by this context.\n\n\n--- After debate on 'To what extent should housing policy prioritize long-term residents over new arrivals to the city?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, so here's the truth: Meier's points about cooperative housing and the need for a strategic approach resonated more than I'd like to admit. I kept hammering on deregulation, but I know it's not a silver bullet, and I can see how it might seem cold or disconnected from the lived experiences of families struggling. Maybe I came off a bit too \"market knows best\" and not enough \"we care about *all* Z\u00fcrchers.\" I performed okay, but I felt a little stiff, like I was reciting talking points. The debate didn't change my core belief that increasing supply is crucial, but I *do* need to integrate a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the role of cooperatives and the importance of community values. I'll need to research and articulate a better balance in the future.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could easing zoning restrictions increase housing supply without significantly altering neighborhood character?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nDamn, Meier actually landed some good punches. Her emphasis on affordability and the potential pitfalls of unchecked private development, especially her examples from other cities, gave me pause. I realize now I need to be more articulate about how deregulation isn't a magic wand. I felt a bit canned, reciting the same old lines, and while I stand by the need for more supply, I have to acknowledge the valid concerns about displacement and community. This experience has highlighted the need to integrate cooperative housing and community values into my approach and show how my policies benefit all, not just the wealthy, even while pushing for deregulation.\nThe housing debate online, especially the emphasis on affordable and cooperative models, truly resonated. Seeing the comments, I found myself genuinely moved by the passion for a livable Z\u00fcrich. It challenged my initial focus on streamlining regulations; I hadn't fully appreciated the depth of feeling around equitable access to housing. My inclination shifted. I started to rethink my emphasis, realizing that a more nuanced approach \u2013 one that prioritizes both supply and affordability \u2013 is crucial. It\u2019s about listening to the people, letting their voices shape my platform while staying true to my core beliefs, making this city better.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could rent controls disproportionately affect lower-income residents and limit housing options?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina Meier's focus on the potential for rent controls to backfire and the need for more housing stock truly made me think. I realize now I need to be more thoughtful about the potential downsides of rent controls and how they can be counterproductive. I felt a bit too focused on supply-side solutions, and I need to show that I care about the immediate needs of Z\u00fcrcher residents. This experience will push me to find a better balance in my approach, emphasizing affordability and cooperative housing as part of a broader strategy that also focuses on the supply side.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could incentivizing the construction of more affordable housing alter neighborhood demographics significantly?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, so here I am, alone again. Meier's points about the potential for unintended consequences from focusing solely on increasing supply, and her emphasis on affordability are something I need to consider seriously. I felt a bit too reliant on my talking points about streamlining regulations. I wasn't entirely inauthentic, but the need to balance that with the genuine concern for community and affordability is key. I need to get better at showing that my proposals benefit all Z\u00fcrchers, not just those with deep pockets. I will carry forward the need to be more nuanced. I must integrate cooperatives and community values into my platform while advocating for a housing supply.\nScrolling through those posts, the genuine fear in people's comments about Z\u00fcrich becoming unaffordable really struck me. I felt a tug \u2013 a pull toward those advocating for cooperative models, a recognition of the need to temper the free market zeal I've held. It challenged me, yes, and that discomfort \u2013 the feeling that I might be wrong \u2013 is something I take seriously. Ultimately, I've decided to slightly adjust my stance to better support those cooperative housing projects. The balance, I realized, comes from listening: not just to the loudest voices, but to the anxieties and hopes that lie beneath the surface. Staying true to my core \u2013 a belief in individual liberty and economic progress \u2013 means evolving how I get there, understanding that genuine progress must benefit everyone.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could restricting short-term rentals help alleviate the housing shortage without harming the tourism sector?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nAlright, Markus, time for brutal honesty. Meier was right on some counts. Her consistent focus on a broader strategy, acknowledging the limits of supply-side solutions, and the need for a more nuanced approach to address housing needs really made me think. I felt a bit too rigid, too focused on my core message of increasing supply, and not enough on the very real worries of everyday Z\u00fcrchers about affordability and community. The debate has definitely exposed a weakness: I need to better articulate a balanced approach, embracing cooperative housing and community values while still pushing for streamlining regulations where possible. From now on, I'll be focusing on demonstrating a comprehensive strategy for Z\u00fcrich's housing, one that addresses supply *and* the vital concerns of affordability and community.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could density bonuses for developers significantly increase housing without altering neighborhood aesthetics?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, so, looking back\u2026 Meier actually made some good points again. Her ability to weave in cooperative models, emphasizing that density bonuses *could* work while also addressing affordability concerns, was effective. I need to get better at that \u2013 at acknowledging the complexities. My focus on streamlining regulations, while valid, felt a bit one-note; I definitely need to articulate a more balanced approach. The debate underscored the need for me to emphasize how my policies will benefit all of Z\u00fcrich, and not just the wealthy. Moving forward, I'll actively incorporate cooperative housing into my platform, recognizing its value while still pushing for increased supply.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "e2b58b68-ef7e-436f-9ade-1ee0c11bcbb2", "policy_positions": {"housing": {"reasoning": "Affordable housing is paramount.
