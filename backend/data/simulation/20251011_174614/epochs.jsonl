(Healthcare Reform) ---\nOkay, Alice Johnson, time to be real with yourself. Bob's point about potential rationing and long wait times in a government-run system definitely gave me pause. I focused on the incentives for specialists, but I didn't really address the practical challenges of resource allocation. My response felt a little too theoretical, not grounded in the realities of how this would work. I need to research those criticisms more deeply and consider how to mitigate those risks. The debate didn't change my core belief that healthcare is a right, but it did highlight the complexity of implementing such a system. I need to be better prepared to answer the tough questions, even if they come from my own side, to avoid sounding overly optimistic.\n", "debate_reflection": "\n--- After debate on 'How would a universal healthcare system affect the availability of specialized medical services?'
