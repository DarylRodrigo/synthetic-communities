(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, Lina, time to be real with yourself. Keller\u2019s argument about supply being the core issue\u2026 it\u2019s a good point. I can\u2019t deny that rent controls alone won't solve the problem. Building more, as he suggested, is crucial, even if I don't fully agree with deregulation. I felt strong, but perhaps a bit rigid, in my opening statement. I should have acknowledged the complexity sooner instead of just dismissing the idea of prioritizing long-term residents outright. While I still believe it risks creating divisions, I need to be more open to exploring potential nuances and solutions that address the underlying supply problem more directly. This experience has reinforced my commitment to affordable housing but also made me realize I need to broaden my approach and be more flexible in considering different solutions.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing shortage in Z\u00fcrich is a serious issue that requires market-based solutions. I favor deregulation and streamlined planning processes to encourage private sector construction and increase the housing supply, while respecting property rights.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nAlright, Markus, time to be brutally honest with yourself. Lina's point about fairness, the potential for a two-tiered system, really hit home. It's a valid concern, and I probably didn't address it with enough nuance. While I still believe deregulation is the long-term solution, I should have acknowledged the very real anxieties that proposals like prioritizing long-term residents are designed to address, even if I don't agree with them. I felt authentic in my focus on supply-side solutions, that's what I truly believe. But I could have shown more empathy. This experience has reinforced my conviction in market-based solutions, but it also highlighted the importance of communicating those solutions in a way that acknowledges and respects the very real problems that people are facing. I need to do better at connecting my policy prescriptions with the human cost of the current situation.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "a81d7342-06a1-4f8c-b8bb-03ccdaedb016", "policy_positions": {"housing_squeeze": {"reasoning": "While acknowledging the housing shortage, prioritizing long-term residents is a problematic approach that could create inequality.
