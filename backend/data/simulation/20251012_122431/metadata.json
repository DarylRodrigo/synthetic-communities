We need to boost the supply of cooperative and affordable housing, and I support measures to protect tenants and prevent discrimination, ensuring everyone has a fair chance at finding a home, regardless of their background or residency duration. Any policies must be carefully considered to avoid unintended consequences and uphold our commitment to inclusivity."

My approach prioritizes free markets: we must cut red tape, streamline building permits, and deregulate to incentivize private developers to build more housing. I oppose any measures that discriminate based on residency status, as this undermines fair access and distorts the market."
