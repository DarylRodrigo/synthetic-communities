I know I need to be more prepared to address that concern head-on. My argument about a healthier population driving demand felt a bit\u2026 simplistic, in retrospect. I definitely felt more comfortable talking about the *why* of universal healthcare \u2013 the equity aspect \u2013 than the *how* it would specifically boost innovation.
