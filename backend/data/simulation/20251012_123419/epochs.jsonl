(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, Lina, time to be honest. Markus made a good point about supply. I can't just dismiss the importance of streamlining construction and encouraging private development. Focusing solely on building more affordable housing, while crucial, isn't the whole picture. Maybe I need to explore ways to incentivize private builders to include affordable units in their projects.\n\nMy performance was okay, but I felt a little too reliant on the \"build more affordable housing\" mantra. It's a strong foundation, but I need to show more nuance. The debate reinforced my commitment to fair housing for all, but I also recognize the need for a more multifaceted approach. Moving forward, I'll research specific policy solutions that tackle supply-side issues without compromising my core values.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing shortage in Z\u00fcrich is a clear consequence of overregulation and insufficient supply. We must prioritize deregulation to incentivize private construction and protect property rights. While I understand the concerns, any policy that prioritizes residents based on origin over fair market principles would be a step in the wrong direction; solutions must be market-based and focused on increasing the overall housing supply."}, "state_memory": "\n--- After debate on 'Would prioritizing residency duration impact housing affordability and segregation in ways that outweigh benefits?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nWell, that was...interesting. Meier's point about deepening segregation resonated more than I'd like to admit. It's a legitimate concern, and while I still believe that prioritizing residency duration is the wrong approach, I need to be more sensitive to the potential consequences of any policy that could be perceived as discriminatory. My focus on deregulation felt authentic, but I fear I didn't spend enough time on the 'how'. Simply saying we need more supply is not enough; I need concrete proposals, not just a talking point. The debate solidified my belief in market-based solutions, but I need to become more adept at addressing the very real fears of those who might feel left behind by such policies. I'll carry forward the need to balance my principles with a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of all Z\u00fcrich residents, especially concerning fair housing.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "b9c542f4-1533-4511-b43a-0a83a342c214", "policy_positions": {"housing_squeeze_rents": {"reasoning": "To address the housing shortage and rising rents in Z\u00fcrich, building more affordable housing is essential, alongside policies that protect all residents.
