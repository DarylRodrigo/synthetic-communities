Tonight, we delve into a critical issue facing Z\u00fcrich, a city grappling with record-low vacancy rates and soaring rents. As policymakers seek solutions, one proposal gaining traction is prioritizing long-term residents in housing allocation. This brings us to our debate: Could policies prioritizing long-term residents exacerbate housing shortages for other demographics?"}, {"type": "candidate", "candidate_id": "candidate_1", "statement": "The housing shortage is a crisis, and any solution that prioritizes one group over another is a dangerous path. Instead of dividing our community, we need to focus on building more affordable housing and implementing strong rent controls. I believe this approach will help ensure that everyone, regardless of how long they've lived here, has a fair chance at a place to call home."}, {"type": "candidate", "candidate_id": "candidate_2", "statement": "Ms. Meier's focus on rent control is a misdirection. Such policies have consistently proven to discourage new construction, ultimately worsening the housing shortage. We need to tackle the root cause: a lack of supply.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, here we go. That was\u2026 intense. Keller's point about rent control potentially discouraging new construction did give me pause. I know it's a common argument, and I need to be prepared to address that nuance more effectively next time. I felt good about sticking to my core belief that we can't solve this crisis by pitting people against each other. My response about not discriminating felt natural, but I need to be more specific about *how* we can achieve that \u2013 maybe more data on successful affordable housing models would help. This debate reinforced my commitment to the idea that everyone deserves a fair shot at housing, but I also know I need to sharpen my responses to counter arguments around rent control and construction incentives. It's not enough to have good intentions; I need concrete solutions and a more nuanced understanding of the complexities.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing shortage is a serious concern, and we need market-based solutions. I support deregulation to encourage private construction and increase housing supply, respecting property rights and avoiding rent controls that stifle investment. Prioritizing residents is problematic; instead, we should streamline permitting, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, and incentivize construction to address the core issue of scarcity."}, "state_memory": "\n--- After debate on 'Could policies prioritizing long-term residents exacerbate housing shortages for other demographics?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nWell, that was\u2026 interesting. Meier's stance on rent control, while I disagree with it fundamentally, did make me think about how deeply people feel the housing pinch. Maybe I need to spend more time listening to those concerns, even if I stick to my market-based solutions. My answer felt solid \u2013 deregulation is the only long-term fix \u2013 but maybe I could have articulated it better. I need to be more persuasive about the *benefits* of deregulation, not just focus on rent control's flaws. I'm more convinced than ever that prioritizing residents is a bad idea, but I need to be ready with data to back up my claims.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "e14d173e-9272-4383-9201-3b8256a2d620", "policy_positions": {"housing_policy": {"reasoning": {"belief": "Policies that prioritize certain groups for housing can exacerbate shortages for others.
