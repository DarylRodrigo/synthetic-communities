I support deregulation to encourage private construction and increase housing supply, respecting property rights and avoiding rent controls that stifle investment. Prioritizing residents is problematic; instead, we should streamline permitting, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, and incentivize construction to address the core issue of scarcity."
