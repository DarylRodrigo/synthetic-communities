(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, Lina, time to be real with yourself. That went\u2026 okay. I think I stayed true to my core belief that discrimination isn't the answer, but Markus Keller's point about supply resonated. He's right, it's not just about *who* gets the housing, but *how much* housing is available. I need to flesh out my own ideas on increasing supply; it's not enough to just say \"build more.\" I sounded a bit too rehearsed at times, focusing on the \"discrimination\" angle, when maybe the conversation needed to be about a more practical solution to provide enough housing, regardless of background. I\u2019ll definitely be researching more market-based approaches, and figuring out how they fit with my ideas on fairness.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing shortage in Z\u00fcrich demands a market-based solution. We need to cut red tape, deregulate construction, and protect property rights to incentivize private developers to build more homes.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nWell, that was\u2026 brief. Lina made a good point about the need for comprehensive solutions, and I have to admit, \"Band-Aid solution\" felt a little glib. My response leaned heavily on the market-based argument, and while I still believe in the power of supply, I realize I didn't address the human element of the housing crisis as well as I could have. I sounded a bit too focused on the abstract principle of fairness, and not enough on the real struggles people face. Perhaps I need to spend more time listening to the concerns of long-term residents, understanding why they feel the need for such policies in the first place. This experience highlighted a need to balance my core beliefs with a more nuanced understanding of the social impact of this crisis.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "c57bba0f-5b17-48db-9c3d-6874495a9407", "policy_positions": {"housing_policy": {"reasoning": "Prioritizing long-term residents for housing access is a superficial fix that doesn't address the core issue of housing supply.
