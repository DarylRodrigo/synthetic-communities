I need to prepare better counterarguments for that \u2013 it's a legitimate concern, even if I disagree with his overall solution. Honestly, I felt a little rehearsed during my opening statement, like I was reciting a slogan. That wasn't entirely authentic.

My response felt a little canned, leaning on the \"wait times and rationing\" argument without offering concrete alternatives beyond vague market solutions. I need to be more specific and show how a free market approach genuinely addresses the problems Alice highlighted.
