(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, Lina, time to be brutally honest with yourself. Keller's point about the lack of supply really hit home. I came in with a strong conviction about rent controls and expanding cooperatives, and those still feel right to me as *part* of the solution, but he's right, we can't ignore the fundamental issue: not enough houses. I felt authentic when I talked about fair housing for everyone, but I stumbled a bit trying to articulate a comprehensive plan beyond my core beliefs. This debate definitely exposed a weakness in my reasoning \u2013 I need to understand the supply side much better. Going forward, I'll be researching the regulatory hurdles to new construction in Z\u00fcrich, and exploring ways to balance supply-side solutions with my core beliefs around fairness and affordability.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing shortage in Z\u00fcrich is a direct result of overregulation and insufficient supply. We need to cut red tape, streamline building permits, and promote private development to increase the housing supply.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nWell, that was\u2026 illuminating. Meier's focus on fairness and cooperatives definitely resonated, even if I think her solutions are ultimately flawed. I need to better address the *perception* of unfairness; simply saying \"more supply solves everything\" feels a little tone-deaf to the immediate struggles people face. I felt authentic sticking to my core belief \u2013 that supply is the root of the problem \u2013 but I could have done a better job connecting that to the *real* anxieties about housing. Perhaps acknowledging the need for *some* safety net while still championing market solutions is a necessary compromise. I'll need to refine how I present this \u2013 it's not just about numbers; it's about people.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "b9c542f4-1533-4511-b43a-0a83a342c214", "policy_positions": {"housing_policy_zurich": {"reasoning": "The housing crisis in Zurich is a complex issue involving both supply and demand.
