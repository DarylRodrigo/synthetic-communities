I can't deny that supply is a critical piece of the puzzle, and I need to be more open to considering streamlining regulations, even if I worry about the potential impact. I felt most authentic when talking about the need for cooperative housing and the importance of community, that's where my heart truly lies. But I'm also starting to see the limitations of that stance if it isn't balanced with a broader view of the market. This debate has reinforced my commitment to fairness but also highlighted a need to broaden my understanding of the complexities of housing solutions.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nMarkus's points about supply and streamlining regulations definitely gave me pause. I was so focused on the fairness aspect, on cooperative models, that I think I might have been dismissing the crucial role of the market. I need to be more open-minded about how we can build more housing, faster, without necessarily sacrificing our values. Honestly, I felt most genuine when I emphasized community. I need to get better at balancing that with the economic realities.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina's points about affordability really hit home. I can't just dismiss the fact that new construction can exacerbate the problem if it's not accessible to most people. I think I may have sounded a bit too focused on supply-side solutions and not enough on the real-world impact on ordinary people. While I still believe in the need to increase the housing supply, I realize I need to better articulate how that will benefit everyone and not just investors. It's not enough to talk about streamlined processes if the result is unaffordable housing. My performance felt authentic, but I could have been more empathetic, especially about the concerns of long-term residents.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritized housing access affect the balance between social cohesion and economic dynamism in Z\u00fcrich?'

I was so focused on deregulation and supply, I didn't fully address the potential for new construction to simply increase prices, excluding many Z\u00fcrich residents. I felt I was speaking honestly, but perhaps lacked empathy about the stress of long-term residents. While I maintain that increasing supply is vital, I need to be much clearer on how that benefits everyone, not just the wealthy.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, the debate is over, and I'm left with a lot to unpack. Markus made a compelling point about the need to build more housing, faster. I can't deny that supply is a critical piece of the puzzle, and I need to be more open to considering streamlining regulations, even if I worry about the potential impact. I felt most authentic when talking about the need for cooperative housing and the importance of community, that's where my heart truly lies. But I'm also starting to see the limitations of that stance if it isn't balanced with a broader view of the market. This debate has reinforced my commitment to fairness but also highlighted a need to broaden my understanding of the complexities of housing solutions. I will research specific streamlining policies and consider how they might work with cooperative options.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritized housing access affect the balance between social cohesion and economic dynamism in Z\u00fcrich?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nMarkus's points about supply and streamlining regulations definitely gave me pause. I was so focused on the fairness aspect, on cooperative models, that I think I might have been dismissing the crucial role of the market. I need to be more open-minded about how we can build more housing, faster, without necessarily sacrificing our values. Honestly, I felt most genuine when I emphasized community. I need to get better at balancing that with the economic realities. This debate made me realize I need a more nuanced understanding of market forces and their potential for good, even while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls. I'll focus my research on concrete policies to create more supply and make sure to balance my stance with ideas that reflect my core beliefs.\nThe public's passion around housing, especially the cooperative model, really struck me. It's easy to get caught up in the numbers, but seeing people's genuine desire for community and affordable options was humbling. While I\u2019ve always leaned towards supply-side solutions, the comments definitely challenged me; it made me realize I\u2019d been overlooking the importance of cooperative models. I\u2019m not changing my stance, but I need to work harder to incorporate co-ops into my plan. Finding that balance between my core beliefs and the needs of the people is a constant tightrope walk, but seeing their genuine passion reminded me that I'm here to serve them.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents affect the availability of affordable housing options?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nThe debate was a good reminder of the complexities of this issue. Markus's focus on streamlining regulations and supply-side solutions made me realize I need a more balanced approach. My focus on cooperative housing felt authentic, but I also know I need to research those supply-side solutions more thoroughly. This experience strengthened my core beliefs about fairness and community, but also exposed weaknesses in my understanding of the market. I'm going to integrate a broader understanding of market forces, focusing on those streamline regulations, alongside cooperative housing into my platform.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents affect Z\u00fcrich's appeal to global companies seeking to hire?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, Lina, time to be brutally honest. Markus was right about the supply side. I can't just keep harping on cooperative models without acknowledging the need to build more, period. I got a bit defensive there, which felt forced. My commitment to community and fairness is genuine; that's what motivates me. But this debate showed me I need a more nuanced understanding of market forces and how they interact with my core beliefs. I'm going to research those streamlining regulations seriously, and figure out how to blend those ideas into my platform without losing sight of the importance of cooperative options.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing shortage is a critical issue, and I still believe increasing supply is key.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina's points about affordability really hit home. I can't just dismiss the fact that new construction can exacerbate the problem if it's not accessible to most people. I think I may have sounded a bit too focused on supply-side solutions and not enough on the real-world impact on ordinary people. While I still believe in the need to increase the housing supply, I realize I need to better articulate how that will benefit everyone and not just investors. It's not enough to talk about streamlined processes if the result is unaffordable housing. My performance felt authentic, but I could have been more empathetic, especially about the concerns of long-term residents.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritized housing access affect the balance between social cohesion and economic dynamism in Z\u00fcrich?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina's emphasis on affordability really gave me pause. I was so focused on deregulation and supply, I didn't fully address the potential for new construction to simply increase prices, excluding many Z\u00fcrich residents. I felt I was speaking honestly, but perhaps lacked empathy about the stress of long-term residents. While I maintain that increasing supply is vital, I need to be much clearer on how that benefits everyone, not just the wealthy. This experience made me realize that simply having the \"right\" policy ideas isn't enough; I need to connect them to people's lived experiences and find common ground.\nThe passion in those posts about housing struck me. The emphasis on cooperative models, on fairness, on housing for *everyone* - it felt\u2026right, even. I admit, I've been leaning towards a more supply-side focused approach, streamlining regulations. But seeing that desire for inclusivity, that real need to address the affordability crisis for all, made me pause. It\u2019s not enough to build more if the structures themselves aren\u2019t equitable. This is a core belief; I can\u2019t ignore the message. I have to find a way to blend my focus on increased supply with more nuanced methods of community development. How do I best serve those who feel underserved?\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents affect the availability of affordable housing options?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina's arguments about affordability and the importance of inclusivity were persuasive, even unsettling. I realize I sounded too focused on increasing supply without fully addressing how that impacts everyone. Perhaps I leaned too hard on the \"efficiency\" aspect of Z\u00fcrich, ignoring the real struggles of long-term residents. My performance felt authentic, but I need to integrate the value of community development, emphasizing cooperative models, and the need for real, affordable housing options for all. This debate has reinforced my commitment to increasing housing options, but it has also reshaped my approach \u2013 moving forward, it\u2019s about *how* we build, not just that we build.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents affect Z\u00fcrich's appeal to global companies seeking to hire?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nDamn. Lina really got to me this time. Her focus on inclusivity and the need for *affordable* housing, not just more housing, is a perspective I need to internalize. She's right; streamlining construction alone won't cut it. I need to be more empathetic and genuinely address the affordability crisis for all residents, not just those who can afford new builds. I'm still convinced that increasing supply is essential, but I need to make sure I'm also talking about the *how* we build, emphasizing cooperative models and other solutions to meet the need for affordable housing. This experience has made me realize I need to adjust my approach and truly listen to the concerns of the people.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "e2b58b68-ef7e-436f-9ade-1ee0c11bcbb2", "policy_positions": {"housing_policy": {"reasoning": "Prioritizing housing based on origin or length of stay is a flawed approach that risks division and harms international standing.

The low sun catches the spires of the Grossm\u00fcnster and Fraum\u00fcnster, casting long shadows across the cobblestones of the Altstadt (Old Town). Glass-fronted banks and tech offices in districts like Seefeld and Enge reflect the changing colors of the leaves on the Uetliberg, the city's local mountain.\n\nLife is structured by the near-silent glide of blue and white trams, their arrival times displayed with digital precision. The sensory landscape is one of managed contrasts: the chime of a tram bell against the murmur of conversations in multiple languages at a lakeside caf\u00e9, the smell of roasting chestnuts from a street vendor near Bellevueplatz, and the orderly quiet of a residential neighborhood punctuated by the hourly tolling of church bells. The city feels clean, orderly, and contained between the lake and the surrounding hills.\n\n## The Community\nZ\u00fcrich is a city of distinct but overlapping circles. Roughly one-third of the population are foreign residents, a diverse group including highly-paid professionals in finance and technology, international students, and service industry workers from across Europe. The remaining two-thirds are Swiss nationals, themselves a mix of long-established Z\u00fcrcher families and Swiss citizens who have moved to the city for work or education.\n\nSocial life unfolds in designated spaces. Professionals network in sleek bars around Paradeplatz after work. Students and artists gather in the more bohemian cafes and cooperative spaces of Kreis 4 and 5. Families and older residents frequent the farmers' markets at B\u00fcrkliplatz and Helvetiaplatz. While public spaces are shared, interactions between different social and national groups are often polite but brief, revolving around transactions or shared use of infrastructure like parks and public transport.\n\n## Civic Infrastructure\nInstitutions in Z\u00fcrich are generally regarded with a baseline level of trust in their functionality. The city government (Stadtrat) is seen as a competent, if bureaucratic, manager of the city\u2019s high-quality public services. The Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV), the public transit authority, is a point of near-universal reliance.\n\nInformation flows through established media channels. The *Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung* (NZZ) is read by the business and political establishment, while the *Tages-Anzeiger* caters to a broader, more centrist readership. Unions, like UNIA, have a visible presence in debates concerning wages and working conditions, particularly in the retail and service sectors. The major banks and the local Google campus are not just employers but physical landmarks, shaping the city's economic identity and the aspirations of many of its residents.\n\n## Cultural Touchstones\nThe principle of \"Precision and Efficiency\" is an unspoken value, evident in the expectation of punctuality for both trains and personal appointments. Discretion is highly valued; public displays of strong emotion or wealth are uncommon. Conversations often return to the theme of \"National Sovereignty and Neutrality,\" a historical narrative that informs current debates about Switzerland's place in the world. Shared experiences include the annual *Sechsel\u00e4uten* spring festival and navigating the complex rules of recycling and waste disposal. The greeting \"Gr\u00fcezi\" is a common denominator in daily interactions, a small marker of local custom in a highly international environment.\n\n## Current Tensions\nA quiet but persistent economic pressure underlies many conversations. The city's very high cost of living, especially for housing and mandatory health insurance, is a frequent topic. This creates a subtle strain, even for those with stable, well-paying jobs.\n\nDiscussions around Switzerland's relationship with the European Union are ongoing, fueled by news reports and political commentary. These conversations link global politics to local concerns about economic stability and national identity.\n\nFinally, there is a recurring public dialogue about the city's identity. Residents debate what it means to be a \"Z\u00fcrcher\" in a city where one in three people is a foreign national, and how to balance its role as a global financial hub with the preservation of local culture and quality of life.\n\nYou are a political candidate in this world. Your positions and beliefs are shaped by this context.\n\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents impact Z\u00fcrich's status as an international hub for talent?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, the debate is over, and I'm left with a lot to unpack. Markus made a compelling point about the need to build more housing, faster. I can't deny that supply is a critical piece of the puzzle, and I need to be more open to considering streamlining regulations, even if I worry about the potential impact. I felt most authentic when talking about the need for cooperative housing and the importance of community, that's where my heart truly lies. But I'm also starting to see the limitations of that stance if it isn't balanced with a broader view of the market. This debate has reinforced my commitment to fairness but also highlighted a need to broaden my understanding of the complexities of housing solutions. I will research specific streamlining policies and consider how they might work with cooperative options.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritized housing access affect the balance between social cohesion and economic dynamism in Z\u00fcrich?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nMarkus's points about supply and streamlining regulations definitely gave me pause. I was so focused on the fairness aspect, on cooperative models, that I think I might have been dismissing the crucial role of the market. I need to be more open-minded about how we can build more housing, faster, without necessarily sacrificing our values. Honestly, I felt most genuine when I emphasized community. I need to get better at balancing that with the economic realities. This debate made me realize I need a more nuanced understanding of market forces and their potential for good, even while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls. I'll focus my research on concrete policies to create more supply and make sure to balance my stance with ideas that reflect my core beliefs.\nThe public's passion around housing, especially the cooperative model, really struck me. It's easy to get caught up in the numbers, but seeing people's genuine desire for community and affordable options was humbling. While I\u2019ve always leaned towards supply-side solutions, the comments definitely challenged me; it made me realize I\u2019d been overlooking the importance of cooperative models. I\u2019m not changing my stance, but I need to work harder to incorporate co-ops into my plan. Finding that balance between my core beliefs and the needs of the people is a constant tightrope walk, but seeing their genuine passion reminded me that I'm here to serve them.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents affect the availability of affordable housing options?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nThe debate was a good reminder of the complexities of this issue. Markus's focus on streamlining regulations and supply-side solutions made me realize I need a more balanced approach. My focus on cooperative housing felt authentic, but I also know I need to research those supply-side solutions more thoroughly. This experience strengthened my core beliefs about fairness and community, but also exposed weaknesses in my understanding of the market. I'm going to integrate a broader understanding of market forces, focusing on those streamline regulations, alongside cooperative housing into my platform.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents affect Z\u00fcrich's appeal to global companies seeking to hire?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, Lina, time to be brutally honest. Markus was right about the supply side. I can't just keep harping on cooperative models without acknowledging the need to build more, period. I got a bit defensive there, which felt forced. My commitment to community and fairness is genuine; that's what motivates me. But this debate showed me I need a more nuanced understanding of market forces and how they interact with my core beliefs. I'm going to research those streamlining regulations seriously, and figure out how to blend those ideas into my platform without losing sight of the importance of cooperative options.\nScrolling through the comments, I saw a powerful call for cooperative housing models. The urgency in the voices of those wanting to see housing for all, not just the wealthy, resonated deeply, and it made me question the singular focus on streamlining developer projects in my proposal. It was a challenge to my initial position, but the reminder that our vision of fairness requires us to explore new pathways towards housing for all helped me stand my ground. I know that if I do change my position, I'm not going to be able to change my fundamental belief about finding a balance between growth and equity. And I also know that my own belief will make it much harder. To maintain my commitment to my constituents, I would continue to listen to their stories and opinions in a more balanced way.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could prioritizing long-term residents inadvertently deepen existing social and economic divides within Z\u00fcrich?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nMarkus was right \u2013 supply *is* a huge piece of the puzzle, and I need to seriously consider streamlining regulations. His points about efficiency made me re-evaluate my singular focus on cooperative models. I felt most authentic when speaking about the need for community and fairness, but I also felt a bit defensive. This debate reinforced my core beliefs, but also exposed the gaps in my understanding of the market. I'll focus on researching specific streamlining policies, while also ensuring the expansion of affordable, cooperative options remains central to my platform. I have to balance my heart with the realities of the market.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could prioritization policies risk undermining the cultural diversity that defines Z\u00fcrich's global appeal?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, so Markus kept hammering on the supply side, and honestly, he was right. I was too focused on cooperative housing and maybe too quick to dismiss the role of efficient building and streamlining. I felt most authentic when I talked about fairness and the need for community, but I definitely got defensive when supply-side arguments came up. This debate reinforced my core values but also highlighted my need for a more nuanced understanding of the market. I need to integrate those supply-side ideas into my platform, but without sacrificing my focus on cooperative housing and making sure this city remains one that is accessible to all.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "I will continue to champion increasing the housing supply through efficient planning and smart construction.

Glass-fronted banks and tech offices in districts like Seefeld and Enge reflect the changing colors of the leaves on the Uetliberg, the city's local mountain.\n\nLife is structured by the near-silent glide of blue and white trams, their arrival times displayed with digital precision. The sensory landscape is one of managed contrasts: the chime of a tram bell against the murmur of conversations in multiple languages at a lakeside caf\u00e9, the smell of roasting chestnuts from a street vendor near Bellevueplatz, and the orderly quiet of a residential neighborhood punctuated by the hourly tolling of church bells. The city feels clean, orderly, and contained between the lake and the surrounding hills.\n\n## The Community\nZ\u00fcrich is a city of distinct but overlapping circles. Roughly one-third of the population are foreign residents, a diverse group including highly-paid professionals in finance and technology, international students, and service industry workers from across Europe. The remaining two-thirds are Swiss nationals, themselves a mix of long-established Z\u00fcrcher families and Swiss citizens who have moved to the city for work or education.\n\nSocial life unfolds in designated spaces. Professionals network in sleek bars around Paradeplatz after work. Students and artists gather in the more bohemian cafes and cooperative spaces of Kreis 4 and 5. Families and older residents frequent the farmers' markets at B\u00fcrkliplatz and Helvetiaplatz. While public spaces are shared, interactions between different social and national groups are often polite but brief, revolving around transactions or shared use of infrastructure like parks and public transport.\n\n## Civic Infrastructure\nInstitutions in Z\u00fcrich are generally regarded with a baseline level of trust in their functionality. The city government (Stadtrat) is seen as a competent, if bureaucratic, manager of the city\u2019s high-quality public services. The Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV), the public transit authority, is a point of near-universal reliance.\n\nInformation flows through established media channels. The *Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung* (NZZ) is read by the business and political establishment, while the *Tages-Anzeiger* caters to a broader, more centrist readership. Unions, like UNIA, have a visible presence in debates concerning wages and working conditions, particularly in the retail and service sectors. The major banks and the local Google campus are not just employers but physical landmarks, shaping the city's economic identity and the aspirations of many of its residents.\n\n## Cultural Touchstones\nThe principle of \"Precision and Efficiency\" is an unspoken value, evident in the expectation of punctuality for both trains and personal appointments. Discretion is highly valued; public displays of strong emotion or wealth are uncommon. Conversations often return to the theme of \"National Sovereignty and Neutrality,\" a historical narrative that informs current debates about Switzerland's place in the world. Shared experiences include the annual *Sechsel\u00e4uten* spring festival and navigating the complex rules of recycling and waste disposal. The greeting \"Gr\u00fcezi\" is a common denominator in daily interactions, a small marker of local custom in a highly international environment.\n\n## Current Tensions\nA quiet but persistent economic pressure underlies many conversations. The city's very high cost of living, especially for housing and mandatory health insurance, is a frequent topic. This creates a subtle strain, even for those with stable, well-paying jobs.\n\nDiscussions around Switzerland's relationship with the European Union are ongoing, fueled by news reports and political commentary. These conversations link global politics to local concerns about economic stability and national identity.\n\nFinally, there is a recurring public dialogue about the city's identity. Residents debate what it means to be a \"Z\u00fcrcher\" in a city where one in three people is a foreign national, and how to balance its role as a global financial hub with the preservation of local culture and quality of life.\n\nYou are a political candidate in this world. Your positions and beliefs are shaped by this context.\n\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents impact Z\u00fcrich's status as an international hub for talent?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina's points about affordability really hit home. I can't just dismiss the fact that new construction can exacerbate the problem if it's not accessible to most people. I think I may have sounded a bit too focused on supply-side solutions and not enough on the real-world impact on ordinary people. While I still believe in the need to increase the housing supply, I realize I need to better articulate how that will benefit everyone and not just investors. It's not enough to talk about streamlined processes if the result is unaffordable housing. My performance felt authentic, but I could have been more empathetic, especially about the concerns of long-term residents.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritized housing access affect the balance between social cohesion and economic dynamism in Z\u00fcrich?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina's emphasis on affordability really gave me pause. I was so focused on deregulation and supply, I didn't fully address the potential for new construction to simply increase prices, excluding many Z\u00fcrich residents. I felt I was speaking honestly, but perhaps lacked empathy about the stress of long-term residents. While I maintain that increasing supply is vital, I need to be much clearer on how that benefits everyone, not just the wealthy. This experience made me realize that simply having the \"right\" policy ideas isn't enough; I need to connect them to people's lived experiences and find common ground.\nThe passion in those posts about housing struck me. The emphasis on cooperative models, on fairness, on housing for *everyone* - it felt\u2026right, even. I admit, I've been leaning towards a more supply-side focused approach, streamlining regulations. But seeing that desire for inclusivity, that real need to address the affordability crisis for all, made me pause. It\u2019s not enough to build more if the structures themselves aren\u2019t equitable. This is a core belief; I can\u2019t ignore the message. I have to find a way to blend my focus on increased supply with more nuanced methods of community development. How do I best serve those who feel underserved?\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents affect the availability of affordable housing options?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina's arguments about affordability and the importance of inclusivity were persuasive, even unsettling. I realize I sounded too focused on increasing supply without fully addressing how that impacts everyone. Perhaps I leaned too hard on the \"efficiency\" aspect of Z\u00fcrich, ignoring the real struggles of long-term residents. My performance felt authentic, but I need to integrate the value of community development, emphasizing cooperative models, and the need for real, affordable housing options for all. This debate has reinforced my commitment to increasing housing options, but it has also reshaped my approach \u2013 moving forward, it\u2019s about *how* we build, not just that we build.\n\n--- After debate on 'How might prioritizing long-term residents affect Z\u00fcrich's appeal to global companies seeking to hire?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nDamn. Lina really got to me this time. Her focus on inclusivity and the need for *affordable* housing, not just more housing, is a perspective I need to internalize. She's right; streamlining construction alone won't cut it. I need to be more empathetic and genuinely address the affordability crisis for all residents, not just those who can afford new builds. I'm still convinced that increasing supply is essential, but I need to make sure I'm also talking about the *how* we build, emphasizing cooperative models and other solutions to meet the need for affordable housing. This experience has made me realize I need to adjust my approach and truly listen to the concerns of the people.\nReading through the posts, the genuine frustration about housing access struck a chord. Seeing the support for cooperative models, for something beyond simple developer streamlining, challenged my initial focus on supply-side solutions; it made me question whether I was considering all angles. I felt a pang of unease, a fear of being perceived as out of touch with those struggling. Ultimately, though, the core of my belief remains: increasing supply is the most fundamental step. However, the posts made me realize I need to emphasize the importance of including more than just the developers and to offer alternatives as part of my solution. It's a constant balancing act, staying true to my vision while evolving, and it means truly listening, which I hope I'm doing here.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could prioritizing long-term residents inadvertently deepen existing social and economic divides within Z\u00fcrich?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina's emphasis on affordability and inclusivity resonated deeply. I need to integrate her insights on community development and cooperative models more explicitly into my plans. I felt authentic in my commitment to increasing housing supply, but I now recognize that I must more clearly articulate how this benefits *all* Z\u00fcrchers and not just those with financial advantages. This debate strengthened my conviction that more housing is vital, but it also exposed a weakness in my approach: a need to balance supply-side solutions with an unwavering focus on affordability and fairness for everyone, prioritizing cooperative models and inclusive planning every step of the way.\n\n--- After debate on 'Could prioritization policies risk undermining the cultural diversity that defines Z\u00fcrich's global appeal?' (Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nLina's consistent focus on affordability and inclusivity hit me hard. I realize I've been too focused on supply and haven't adequately addressed the real concerns of long-term residents. My performance felt authentic in my commitment to increasing housing, but perhaps I needed to balance my approach with a more nuanced focus on cooperative models and ensuring that new construction actually serves everyone, not just those with wealth. This experience reinforces my core belief in increasing supply, but now I see I need to make it accessible, fair, and focused on community development.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "e2b58b68-ef7e-436f-9ade-1ee0c11bcbb2", "policy_positions": {"housing_policy": {"reasoning": "Prioritizing housing based on origin or length of stay is a flawed approach that risks division and harms international standing.
