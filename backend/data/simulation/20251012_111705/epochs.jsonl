(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, Lina, time to be real. Markus Keller was right; I can't just dismiss the supply issue. Saying we need *only* cooperative housing might be too simplistic, even if it's the approach I believe in the most. It made me wonder if I need to be more open to exploring other solutions, even if they feel less aligned with my core principles.\n\nI felt authentic in advocating for fairness and equal access, but I also felt I could have articulated the complexities of supply and demand better. My performance was solid, but perhaps a little too focused on the negative aspects of prioritizing long-term residents, and not enough on the overall picture.\n\nThe debate reinforced my conviction that we need a multifaceted approach to the housing crisis, and that I have to understand and be prepared to address the other points of view, even the ones that I oppose. I will research more on private investment and regulations, making sure I can provide a nuanced view in the future.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing shortage is a market issue, and we need to increase supply through deregulation and streamlining building permits.

I felt a little too quick to dismiss cooperative housing, even though I still believe in the core of my argument \u2013 that we need more supply. I think I could have been more empathetic towards the concerns of long-term residents, while still holding firm on my market-based solutions. My delivery felt authentic, but maybe a little too\u2026 unwavering?
