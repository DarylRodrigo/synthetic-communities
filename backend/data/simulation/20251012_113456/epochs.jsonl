(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, Lina, time to be brutally honest with yourself. That debate felt\u2026 fine. I articulated my position clearly, hammering home the need for more affordable housing and rent controls. But did I really *connect*? Keller's point about streamlining development to encourage private investment gave me pause, even though I still believe focusing solely on private sector solutions leaves many behind. My response felt a bit rehearsed, lacking that spark of genuine conviction I strive for. I need to dig deeper into the practical challenges of increasing supply and consider how to balance my ideals with pragmatic solutions. This experience has strengthened my resolve to fight for fairer housing, but it also highlighted the need for more nuanced thinking and a willingness to explore different approaches.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing shortage in Z\u00fcrich demands a market-based solution.

Her emphasis on cooperative models actually gave me pause \u2013 I need to dig deeper on the viability of those models, because dismissing them outright might be a mistake. I felt pretty solid about my focus on deregulation, it aligns with my core beliefs about market efficiency. However, maybe I could have articulated the benefits of market-based solutions more compellingly, instead of just saying \"build more.\" The debate reinforced my belief in the importance of supply, but it also highlighted the need for a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the very real anxieties of Z\u00fcrich residents.
