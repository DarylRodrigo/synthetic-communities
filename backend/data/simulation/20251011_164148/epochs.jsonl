(Healthcare Reform) ---\nWell, that was\u2026intense. Bob's point about potential rationing and wait times, *that* got to me. I hadn't considered that specific consequence of a government-run system as deeply as I should have. My response felt a bit canned, like I was reciting a policy platform rather than truly grappling with the complexity of the issue. I need to do more research on the experiences of other countries with universal healthcare, to be prepared for those kinds of counter-arguments. Ultimately, the debate solidified my belief in the importance of universal access, but I need to be more nuanced in my understanding of the challenges.\n", "debate_reflection": "\n--- After debate on 'How would universal healthcare impact the quality and availability of specialized medical services?'

I think I performed okay, but my response felt a little canned, relying on the usual talking points about rationing.
