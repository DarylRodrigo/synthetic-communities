(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nOkay, Lina, time to be real. Keller's point about focusing on *building more* housing, rather than fighting over who gets what's available, hit me harder than I'd like to admit. It made me question if I was focusing too much on the symptoms and not enough on the root cause. I felt authentic sticking to my anti-discrimination stance, that's easy for me. However, I'm now thinking I need to flesh out my solutions beyond \"build more co-ops\". I need to be more specific about *how* to increase supply, addressing Keller's point about red tape and private development. This debate definitely strengthens my conviction about fairness, but I realize I need to be more nuanced and practical in my approach to actually solving the housing crisis.\n"}, {"id": "candidate_2", "policy_positions": {"topic_1": "The housing shortage demands a free-market approach.

(Housing squeeze & rents) ---\nWell, that was\u2026 interesting. Meier\u2019s point about avoiding division and building more affordable housing resonated, even if her solutions differ from mine. I'm a little too quick to dismiss anything that isn't a free-market approach, and I need to acknowledge the potential for genuine need among long-term residents. I felt authentic sticking to my guns on the supply issue \u2013 it's the core of the problem, and I truly believe in it. However, perhaps I need to be more open to discussing the nuanced impacts of different solutions, and less quick to dismiss competing ideas. This experience has reinforced my belief in the free market, but also highlighted the importance of empathy and considering multiple angles.\n"}], "population_votes": [{"id": "b9c542f4-1533-4511-b43a-0a83a342c214", "policy_positions": {"housing": {"reasoning": "The housing situation in Z\u00fcrich is a complex issue, and while increasing supply is a key strategy, it's important to ensure that this process doesn't create new barriers for certain groups, necessitating a balanced approach that considers fair access.", "vote": ""}, "housing_solutions": {"reasoning": "Increasing housing supply through faster development and reduced red tape is a crucial strategy, but the process must be carefully managed to ensure fair access for all residents.", "vote": ""}, "fair_housing": {"reasoning": "Ensuring fair access to housing for all residents, regardless of origin or tenure, is an important consideration that should be integrated into strategies for addressing housing shortages, even as supply is increased.", "vote": ""}, "urban_policy": {"reasoning": "Policies aimed at addressing urban challenges like housing shortages need to be carefully evaluated for their potential to create or exacerbate inequalities, and must consider the human element beyond just increasing output.", "vote": ""}}, "overall_vote": ""}, {"id": "dc9e8f2c-17a7-4567-a6e4-27ecb48f2102", "policy_positions": {"housing": {"reasoning": "The housing crisis in Z\u00fcrich is a serious issue primarily stemming from a lack of supply.
