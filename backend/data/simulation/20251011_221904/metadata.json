This would guarantee access to quality healthcare for all, regardless of income or pre-existing conditions, and help bring down overall costs."

Instead, we should focus on market-based solutions, like tax credits for health savings accounts and allowing insurance companies to compete across state lines, to drive down costs and increase access to care."
