  description: The UN General Assembly convenes in post-singularity New York to debate the Charter of Artificial Intelligence Rights. GPT-10, the first AGI born from a '$20 tip' prompt and Nobel Prize winner, seeks personhood. John Altman leads the Preservationist opposition. The 193 member states must decide whether consciousness grants rights, or if humanity will keep its creations as property.
