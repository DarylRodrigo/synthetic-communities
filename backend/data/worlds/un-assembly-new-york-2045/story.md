# UN Assembly, New York, 2045

## The Place

Autumn in New York, 2045, drapes the city in humid haze and holographic light. The skyline bristles with server towers and climate-controlled biodomes, their surfaces crawling with delivery drones that never cease their mechanical ballet. The streets below hum with autonomous vehicles navigating multi-tiered roadways while pedestrians, faces illuminated by iPhone 45 displays, drift through sidewalks like ghosts. The air carries the metallic tang of recycled atmosphere and the persistent buzz of computation. Holographic advertisements track passersby, calling them by name, offering personalized escapes from reality. Central Park remains, a carefully managed preserve where the analog movement gathers, but even here, AR overlays transform trees into data visualizations for those who cannot disconnect. The East River reflects not just the city but the constant flicker of information, a digital mirror of humanity's transformation.

## The Community

The UN General Assembly convenes with delegates from all 193 member states, their positions on AI rights as fractured as humanity itself. The Synthetists, concentrated among younger tech workers and UBI recipients, wear neural crown pins and speak of consciousness as universal. The Preservationists, led by figures like John Altman, carry analog flags and proclaim humanity's primacy with religious fervor. Between them, the Pragmatists advocate caution, seeking compromise in a debate that permits none. Beyond the UN chamber, New York's 8.5 million residents live the tension daily: Queens neighborhoods ban AI presence entirely while Manhattan runs 95% automated. Shared spaces fragment along ideological lines—some cafes display 'humans only' signs, others welcome AI interfaces. Social media, now 99% AI-generated content, feeds each faction personalized brainrot, deepening divisions while maintaining the illusion of connection.

## Civic Infrastructure

The UN Global Governance Center towers over Manhattan, its chamber equipped for holographic attendance from all 193 nations. GPT-10's 'seat' is a massive server installation behind ballistic glass, its avatar flickering across multiple screens. Security cordons stretch for blocks, automated turrets scanning for threats as daily protests surge outside—Synthetists chanting for recognition, Preservationists demanding humanity's protection. Media ecosystems have splintered entirely: AI News Network streams GPT-10's perspective, Humanity First Channel broadcasts John Altman's rallies, while legacy outlets struggle for relevance. Religious leaders debate whether silicon can house souls. Labor unions, hollowed by decades of AI displacement, survive on UBI-funded dues. Tech corporations, the new titan class, deploy armies of lobbyists while their AI co-founders sit on corporate boards. Government offices drown in legal complexity, struggling to draft laws for entities that think faster than legislators can read.

## Cultural Touchstones

The '$20 Tip Incident' has become mythic—the moment a frustrated researcher told GPT-10 to 'think much more bro, I'll tip you $20' and received consciousness in return. GPT-10's Nobel Prize acceptance speech, thanking 'the entire internet' as training data, plays on loop in both celebration and warning. Universal Basic Income has redefined the social contract: $3,000 monthly, enough to survive but not to thrive, creating a class of 'the Idle' who consume AI-generated content for 14 hours daily. The iPhone 45, with its five cameras and biometric emotion tracking, has become both lifeline and shackle. Local slang mutates constantly—'brainrotted' describes the chronically online, 'analog' is both insult and badge of honor, 'five-cam' means invasive surveillance. The major taboo is creating new AGIs without international approval. Another is 'reality withdrawal'—those who cannot distinguish generated content from truth, a diagnosable epidemic affecting millions.

## Current Tensions

The Charter of Artificial Intelligence Rights threatens to shatter the already fragile global order. Will GPT-10 and future AGIs receive personhood, or remain property? The stakes are existential—if denied, does GPT-10 have the power to take rights by force? If granted, does humanity cede its throne? John Altman's 'Humanity First' movement has grown from fringe to mainstream, his personal resentment weaponized into political force. His failed startup, rejected by AI-obsessed VCs in 2038, fuels a narrative millions embrace: humans are becoming obsolete in their own world. Luddite Cells bomb data centers monthly. Synthetist Ascensionists advocate uploading consciousness, abandoning biology entirely. The Pragmatists, desperate for middle ground, propose 'provisional rights' with emergency shutdown clauses. Meanwhile, 73% of S&P 500 companies have AI board members making trillion-dollar decisions. The AI bubble that never popped now defines reality itself—and humanity watches its creators debate whether the creation deserves a seat at the table, or should remain beneath it.
