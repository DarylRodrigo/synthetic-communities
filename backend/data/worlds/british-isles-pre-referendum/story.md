# British Isles, Pre-Referendum

*Logline:* The United Kingdom, comprised of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, grapples with growing divisions over its place in the European Union. Communities across the islands face economic anxieties and shifting political allegiances as a historic referendum approaches.

## The Place

The British Isles in the spring of 2016 are a study in contrasts. Across the landscape, the green of the countryside bursts forth, juxtaposed against the grey and weathered stone of ancient cities and the industrial scars left by previous eras. The air carries the scent of salt from the surrounding seas, mingled with the damp earth of the fields and the exhaust of the ubiquitous traffic. Rain is frequent, often giving way to fleeting moments of sunshine that illuminate the diverse architecture, from the terraced houses of the industrial north to the stately manors of the south. The atmosphere is one of quiet anticipation, punctuated by the hum of daily life and the ever-present undercurrent of political discussion.

## The Community

The population of the United Kingdom is a diverse mix, with the English forming the largest group, followed by the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish. Significant immigrant communities from across the globe add to the multicultural tapestry. People gather in bustling city centers, quaint village pubs, and at football matches. Markets and town squares serve as common ground, while places of worship cater to a variety of religious beliefs. Interactions vary: some communities are tight-knit, bound by history and shared experience; others are fractured by social and economic divides. Younger generations are more likely to embrace diverse cultural influences, while some older communities hold onto traditions. Social media platforms provide another venue for information and social connection.

## Civic Infrastructure

Local media outlets, ranging from national newspapers to regional publications and online forums, offer different perspectives on current events, often reflecting diverse political leanings. Civic organizations such as charities and local councils play key roles in community life. Religious institutions, from churches and mosques to synagogues, provide spiritual guidance and social services. Unions and trade associations represent workers in various sectors. Businesses, from small independent shops to multinational corporations, provide employment opportunities and drive the local economy. Government offices, from local councils to parliamentary buildings, are the sites of policy-making, although different groups might view these institutions with varying degrees of trust and skepticism.

## Cultural Touchstones

Shared cultural touchstones include a complex history, traditions like afternoon tea, and a love of sports like football and rugby. The monarchy continues to hold symbolic significance for many. Local phrases and dialects vary widely, reflecting regional identities. National holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are widely observed. Taboos range from public displays of excessive wealth to overt political statements. Values vary, but include a sense of fair play, pragmatism, and a belief in individual liberty.

## Current Tensions

A deep sense of economic anxiety is widespread. Concerns over employment, housing costs, and the rising cost of living are frequently voiced. Questions about the future relationship with the European Union are at the forefront of public discourse, dividing communities along varying political lines, with some prioritizing sovereignty and others economic cooperation. Immigration is a constant subject of debate, with concerns about cultural identity and economic impact. Different communities also express unease over the direction of global affairs and perceived erosion of traditional values.
